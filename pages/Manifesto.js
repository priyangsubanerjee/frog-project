            Beyond the stars, beyond the night, A future bright, a cosmic sight.
            Vast and endless, the expanse calls, With promise of discovery, and
            new horizons for us all.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through the void, we journey forth, To explore, to learn, to grow.
            With every step, we break new ground, And our understanding
            continues to flow.
            <br />
            <br />
            The mysteries of the universe, Await to be unraveled, As we reach
            for the stars, Our horizons are forever traveled.
            <br />
            <br />
            With each new discovery, We take one step further, Towards a future
            that&apos;s bright, And the possibilities that we offer.
            <br />
            <br />
            So come and join us, On this journey to the sky, For the future is
            ours, And it&apos;s time for us to fly.
            <br />
            <br />- TO THE MOON AND NEVER BACK
